> # SMS-Email-Spam-Detector

<p>
Developing a machine learning-based application for detecting SMS
and Email spam messages. A dataset consisting of spam and ham
messages is taken from Kaggle. Jupyter Notebook was used for
writing pynb script.
</p>
<p>
Libraries I have learnt and used during the project: pandas, nltk,
sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, and streamlit.
</p>
<p>
Precision and accuracy was found to be the most using the
Multinomial Naive Bayes classiÔ¨Åer and TFIDF vectorizer.
